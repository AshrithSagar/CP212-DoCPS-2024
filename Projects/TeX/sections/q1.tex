\section*{Question 1}

How motors and encoders interface with the Microbit board.

\subsection*{Solution}

The motors are controlled via PWM signals generated by the \texttt{nRF52833} microcontroller.
The speed and direction of the motors are adjusted by varying the duty cycle of these PWM signals, and by appropriately setting the direction pins of the motor driver, respectively.
The encoders, which are connected to the \texttt{GPIO} pins of the microcontroller, generate pulses as the motors rotate.
These pulses are counted and timed to calculate motor speed in \texttt{RPM} (revolutions per minute).
The system uses interrupts to handle pulse events efficiently and timers to calculate the time difference between pulses, ensuring accurate speed measurement in a non-blocking way.
This is done by configuring the \texttt{GPIOTE} registers to track the rising and falling edges of the encoder pulses.
