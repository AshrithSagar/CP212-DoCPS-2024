\section*{Question 1}

How motors and encoders interface with the Microbit board.

\subsection*{Solution}

The motors are controlled via PWM signals generated by the NRF52833 microcontroller.
The speed and direction of the motors are adjusted by varying the duty cycle of these PWM signals.
The encoders, which are connected to the GPIO pins of the microcontroller, generate pulses as the motors rotate.
These pulses are counted and timed to calculate motor speed (in RPM or m/s).
The system uses interrupts to handle pulse events efficiently and timers to calculate the time difference between pulses, ensuring accurate speed measurement in a non-blocking way.
