\section*{Question 1}

How many GPIO pins does NRF52833 have?
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item The schematic tells us that the part number is nRF52833-QIAA.\@
    \item Section 10.3 tells us the meaning of QIAA.\@
    \item Section 7.1.1 tells us pin configuration for QFN73 package.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

The general purpose input/output pins (GPIOs) in NRF52833 are grouped into two ports, P0 and P1, with each port having up to 32 GPIOs.
Thereby, there are \underline{64 GPIO pins}.

The part number mentioned in the schematic is \texttt{nRF52833-QIAA}.
It is a part of the \texttt{nRF52} series products, with part code \texttt{833}.
\texttt{QI} denotes the package variant, indicating that the size of the package is \( 7\times 7 \) mm, with a pin/ball count of 73 and a pitch of 0.5 mm.
\texttt{QI} denotes the function variant, having flash memory of 512 kB and RAM of 128 kB.\@
