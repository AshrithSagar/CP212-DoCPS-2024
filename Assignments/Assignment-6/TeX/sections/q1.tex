\section*{Question 1}

How many GPIO pins does NRF52833 have?
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item The schematic tells us that the part number is nRF52833-QIAA.\@
    \item Section 10.3 tells us the meaning of QIAA.\@
    \item Section 7.1.1 tells us pin configuration for QFN73 package.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

The general purpose input/output pins (GPIOs) in \texttt{nRF52833} are grouped into two ports, P0 and P1, with each port having up to 32 GPIOs.\\
There are 32+10=\underline{42 GPIO pins} in \texttt{nRF52833}.

Port P0 has 32 GPIO pins, numbered from 0 to 31.

Port P1 has 10 GPIO pins, numbered from 0 to 9.

The GPIO port peripheral implements up to 32 pins, \texttt{PIN0} through \texttt{PIN31}.
Each of these pins can be individually configured in the \texttt{PIN\_CNF[n]} registers (n=0..31).

The corresponding associated registers are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{OUT} --- Write GPIO port
    \item \texttt{OUTSET} --- Set individual bits
    \item \texttt{OUTCLR} --- Clear individual bits
    \item \texttt{IN} --- Read GPIO port
    \item \texttt{DIR} --- Direction of GPIO pins
    \item \texttt{DIRSET} --- Set bits in DIR register
    \item \texttt{DIRCLR} --- Clear bits in DIR register
    \item \texttt{LATCH} --- Latch register
    \item \texttt{DETECTMODE} --- Select between DETECT or LDETECT signal mode
    \item \texttt{PIN\_CNF[n]} --- Configuration of GPIO pins
          \subitem~n = 0 to 31
\end{itemize}
