\section*{Question 3}

Familiarize with the GPIO registers in section 6.8 of the product specifications.
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item What is the diï¬€erence between OUT, OUTSET and OUTCLR registers?
    \item What are the addresses of pin configuration register for the two push buttons?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsubsection*{(a) Registers \texttt{OUT}, \texttt{OUTSET}, and \texttt{OUTCLR}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{OUT} register is used to write GPIO port.
    \item \texttt{OUTSET} register is used to set individual bits in GPIO port.
    \item \texttt{OUTCLR} register is used to clear individual bits in GPIO port.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{(b) Push buttons}
