\section*{Question 3}

Familiarize with the GPIO registers in section 6.8 of the product specifications.
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item What is the diï¬€erence between OUT, OUTSET and OUTCLR registers?
    \item What are the addresses of pin configuration register for the two push buttons?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsubsection*{(a) Registers \texttt{OUT}, \texttt{OUTSET}, and \texttt{OUTCLR}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{OUT} register is used to write GPIO port.
    \item \texttt{OUTSET} register is used to set individual bits in GPIO port.
    \item \texttt{OUTCLR} register is used to clear individual bits in GPIO port.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{(b) Push buttons}

From the schematic, we can see that the two push buttons are connected to pins \texttt{P0.14} and \texttt{P0.23}.
The address offset for the pin configuration register \texttt{PIN\_CNF[n]} is given by \( \hex{0x700} + n \times \hex{0x4} \), where \( n \) is the pin number.
The base address for Port \texttt{P0} is given by \( \hex{0x5000 0000} \).
Thereby, we have the addresses of the pin configuration registers for the two push buttons as
\begin{align*}
    \text{Push button A} & : \hex{0x5000 0700} + 14 \times \hex{0x4} = \boxed{\hex{0x5000 0738}} \\
    \text{Push button B} & : \hex{0x5000 0700} + 23 \times \hex{0x4} = \boxed{\hex{0x5000 075C}}
\end{align*}
