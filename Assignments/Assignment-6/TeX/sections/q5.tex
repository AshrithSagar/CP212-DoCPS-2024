\section*{Question 5}

Search and find out five applications of GPIO peripheral.

\subsection*{Solution}

GPIO peripherals are quite versatile and can be used in a variety of applications.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Display interface\\
          Can interface with displays to show information.\\
          Can control state of LED by turning them ON or OFF

    \item Button press detection\\
          Allows user interaction by detecting button press by reading the state of the button

    \item Sensor data acquisition\\
          Can read data from sensors connected to GPIO pins,\\
          like temperature sensor, light sensors, etc.

    \item Motor control\\
          Can control the speed and direction of motors

    \item Communication interface\\
          Can be used for communication and configured with protocols such as I2C, SPI, UART

\end{enumerate}
