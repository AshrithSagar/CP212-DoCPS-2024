\section*{Question 4}

I continued running the code.
However, while running the code, I forgot to update the prototype in main.c, which remained:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int linear(int x);
\end{lstlisting}

I stepped through the code from main onwards.

In main, the value of global variable x was correctly shown as 10.
But when I stepped into linear, I saw the argument x to have the value 1.40129846e-44.
And when the function returned, the value of global variable y was shown as 1073741824.

Why is this happening?
Is the compiler buggy?
