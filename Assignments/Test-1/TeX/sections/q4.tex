\section*{Question 4}

I continued running the code.
However, while running the code, I forgot to update the prototype in \texttt{main.c}, which remained:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int linear(int x);
\end{lstlisting}

I stepped through the code from \texttt{main} onwards.

In \texttt{main}, the value of global variable \texttt{x} was correctly shown as \texttt{10}.
But when I stepped into \texttt{linear}, I saw the argument \texttt{x} to have the value \texttt{1.40129846e-44}.
And when the function returned, the value of global variable \texttt{y} was shown as \texttt{1073741824}.

Why is this happening?
Is the compiler buggy?
