\section*{Question 4}

Repeat question 3 for -1.0.

\subsection*{Solution}

The only difference here is that the signed bit is set to 1, indicating that the number is negative. The rest of the bits remain the same as in the case of \texttt{float x = 1.0}.

Therefore, the variable \texttt{float x = -1.0} is stored as \(\boxed{\texttt{0xBF800000}}\) in memory.
