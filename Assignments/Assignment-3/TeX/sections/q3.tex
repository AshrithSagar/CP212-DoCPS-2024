\section*{Question 3}

Set a variable \verb|float x = 1.0|.
View it as an unsigned long in the memory window.
What value do you see?
Explain it theoretically.

\subsection*{Solution}

Floating-point numbers are stored in the memory according to the IEEE 754 standard.
According to it, the variable \texttt{float x = 1.0} is stored internally as following:
