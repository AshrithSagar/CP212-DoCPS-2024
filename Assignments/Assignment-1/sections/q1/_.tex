\section*{Question 1}

Draw a block diagram of microbit board including the following: CPU, ROM, RAM and peripheral ports.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Which CPU does microbit use? Specify the exact part number.
    \item How much ROM does it have? What is the address range mapped to it?
    \item How much RAM does it have? What is / are the address range(s)?
\end{enumerate}

\newcommand{\hex}[1]{\texttt{#1}}
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item The \texttt{micro:bit\;v2} board uses the \textbf{Nordic Semiconductor nRF52833} System-on-Chip (SoC) as its CPU, which is an ARM Cortex-M4, with 64 MHz maximum clock frequency, 128 KB RAM and 512 KB flash.
          The exact part number is nRF52833-QIAA.\@
    \item The \texttt{micro:bit\;v2} board has \textbf{512 KB} of ROM.\\
          The address range mapped to it is \hex{0x00000} to \hex{0x7FFFF}.
    \item The \texttt{micro:bit\;v2} board has \textbf{128 KB} of RAM.\\
          The address range mapped to it is \hex{0x20000000} to \hex{0x2001FFFF}.
\end{enumerate}
