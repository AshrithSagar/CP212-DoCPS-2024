\section*{Question 3}

\lstinputlisting[language={}, frame=single, caption={Incorrect code}, linewidth=\linewidth]{../Codes/q3.c}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Opening docstring comment has no corresponding closing tag

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Not shown

          \textbf{Fix:}
          Add \texttt{*/} at the end of the comment.
          Multi-line comments should be enclosed within \texttt{/* */}.
          This is a semantic error and will not show up during compilation.

    \item Undefined type of array \texttt{c}

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Compilation

          \textbf{Fix:}
          Add \texttt{int} before the array \texttt{c}

    \item Invalid values in array \texttt{c}

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Compilation

          \textbf{Fix:}
          9ABC, DEF0 are not valid hexadecimal numbers and should be prefixed with \texttt{0x}.

          Corrected line
          \begin{lstlisting}[language=C, frame=single]
const int c[4] = {1234, 5678, 0x9ABC, 0xDEF0};
            \end{lstlisting}

    \item Should be \texttt{printf} instead of \texttt{printff}

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Compilation

\end{enumerate}
