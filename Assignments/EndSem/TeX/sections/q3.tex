\lstinputlisting[language={}, frame=single, caption={Incorrect code}, linewidth=\linewidth]{../Codes/q3.c}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Opening docstring comment has no corresponding closing tag

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Not shown

          \textbf{Fix:}
          Add \texttt{*/} at the end of the comment.
          Multi-line comments should be enclosed within \texttt{/* */}.
          This is a semantic error and will not show up during compilation.

    \item Undefined type of array \texttt{c}

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Compilation

          \textbf{Fix:}
          Add \texttt{int} before the array \texttt{c}

    \item Invalid values in array \texttt{c}

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Compilation

          \textbf{Fix:}
          9ABC, DEF0 are not valid hexadecimal numbers and should be prefixed with \texttt{0x}.

          Suggested fix:
          \begin{lstlisting}[language=C, frame=single]
const int c[4] = {1234, 5678, 0x9ABC, 0xDEF0};
            \end{lstlisting}

    \item Undefined loop variable \texttt{i}

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Compilation

          \textbf{Fix:}
          Add \texttt{int} before the loop variable \texttt{i}

    \item Incorrect loop bounds

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Compilation

          \textbf{Fix:}
          The array \texttt{c} has only 4 elements, indexed from 0 to 3.
          The loop should run from 0 to 3, and not 0 to 4, as the latter will cause an out-of-bounds error.

          Suggested fix:
          \begin{lstlisting}[language=C, frame=single]
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            \end{lstlisting}

    \item Undefined \texttt{printff}

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Compilation, if \texttt{TEST} was defined previously, else will not show up

          \textbf{Fix:}
          Replace \texttt{printff} with \texttt{printf}

    \item Incorrect ordering in \texttt{printf} format string

          \textbf{Stage at which they show up:}
          Not shown up

          \textbf{Fix:}
          Should interchange the order of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} in the format string.
          This is a logical error and will not throw an error during compilation.

\end{enumerate}
