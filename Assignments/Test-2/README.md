# Test-2

> Note:
You may refer to written material, internet resources etc. for exploration and learning.
However, the answers must be written in your own words.
The test includes programming, to be implemented on Microbit board and Keil MDK.
This is an individual test.
Collaboration is not permitted.

## Part 1. Coding

Integrate the exercise with the buttons and display with the minimal startup code.
Since the startup code does not perform C run-time initializations, you may have to rewrite your code using only constants (`.rodata`) and uninitialized variables (`.data`).

## Part 2. Memory map

Draw the memory map of your program, mapping each symbol along with its type (code or data), section name and the associated address range.

You may use a table (as shown below) or a pictorial representation, whichever appears suitable to you.

| Symbol | Start Address | End Address | Type | Section |
|--------|---------------|-------------|------|---------|

## Submit

1. Source code
2. Photo(s) or a small video of your program running
3. Memory map
