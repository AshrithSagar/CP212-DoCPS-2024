Attached the code integrating the exercise with the buttons and display with the minimal startup code, along with a small video demonstrating the functionality of the code.
The LED matrix displays a left arrow as long as the left button is pressed, and similarly for the right button.
The display is blank when none of the buttons are pressed.
