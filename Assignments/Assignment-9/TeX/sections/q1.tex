\section*{Question 1}

What does ``A'' in UART stand for?
What does it mean?
What are its advantages and disadvantages?

\subsection*{Solution}

UART stands for ``Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter''.
The ``A'' in UART stands for ``Asynchronous'', which means that the transmitter and receiver are not synchronized by a common clock signal.

\subsubsection*{Advantages of UART}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Simple to implement.
    \item Can be used to communicate between devices with different clock speeds.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Disadvantages of UART}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Slower compared to synchronous communication.
    \item Requires additional bits for synchronization.
\end{itemize}
