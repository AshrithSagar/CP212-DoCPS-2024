\section*{Question 2}

What is the role of R4 and R5 resistors?

\subsection*{Solution}

The resistors \texttt{R4} and \texttt{R5} are \underline{pull-up resistors}.
Their role is to ensure the input lines \texttt{BTN\_A} and \texttt{BTN\_B} are pulled to a high level (\texttt{VREG}) when the switches \texttt{SW2} and \texttt{SW3} are open.

Without these resistors, the input would be floating, potentially causing erratic behavior in the microcontroller.
