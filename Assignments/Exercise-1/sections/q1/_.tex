\section*{Question 1}

Draw a block diagram of microbit board including the following: CPU, ROM, RAM and peripheral ports.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Which CPU does microbit use? Specify the exact part number.
    \item How much ROM does it have? What is the address range mapped to it?
    \item How much RAM does it have? What is / are the address range(s)?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\newcommand{\hex}[1]{\texttt{#1}}
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item The micro:bit v2 board uses the \textbf{Nordic Semiconductor nRF52833} System-on-Chip (SoC) as its CPU.\@
    \item The micro:bit v2 board has \textbf{512 KB} of ROM.\@
          The address range mapped to it is \hex{0x00000} to \hex{0x7FFFF}.
    \item The micro:bit v2 board has \textbf{128 KB} of RAM. The address range mapped to it is \hex{0x20000000} to \hex{0x2001FFFF}.
\end{enumerate}
