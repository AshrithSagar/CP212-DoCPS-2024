\section*{Question 1}

Draw a block diagram of microbit board including the following: CPU, ROM, RAM and peripheral ports.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Which CPU does microbit use? Specify the exact part number.
    \item How much ROM does it have? What is the address range mapped to it?
    \item How much RAM does it have? What is / are the address range(s)?
\end{enumerate}
