\section*{Minimal system}

In this exercise, you will implement a standalone system with your own startup code.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
    \item Create project without CMSIS Core and Device.
    \item Create a \(\texttt{start.c}\) file as discussed in the lab session.
    \item Add two files supplied with this assignment:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \(\texttt{linear.c}\): Implements integer \(y = mx + c\), where \(m\) and \(c\) are 32-bit constants.
              \item \(\texttt{main.c}\): Calls \(\texttt{linear()}\) with diï¬€erent values of \(x\).
          \end{itemize}
    \item Fill in the following table.
          Specify the type to be one of:
          function, read-only data, initialized data, uninitialized data, local data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{tables/data.tex}
\end{table}

The corresponding symbols window is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:symbols}.

\newpage
As for the local variable \( \texttt{i} \), it is stored in the stack as and when required, on run-time.
It turns out that the Stack Pointer (SP) points to \( \hex{0x2000001C} \) when the program was running, which is where the variable \( \texttt{i} \) is stored.

The \( \texttt{.bss} \) section indicates ``block starting symbol'', indicating that the variables are declared but not being assigned a value yet.
