\section*{Question 3}

What are the sizes of various sections in your executable?\\
What is the total ROM and RAM requirement?

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsubsection*{Sizes of various sections}

We can observe the size of each of the section in the third column in Table~\ref{tab:map}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \resizebox{0.9\textwidth}{!}{
        \input{tables/map.tex}
    }
    \caption{
        Memory Map
    }\label{tab:map}
\end{table}

\clearpage
\subsubsection*{Total ROM and RAM requirements}

When the program is compiled, we get the following log,
\[
    \texttt{
        Program Size: Code=104 RO-data=72 RW-data=32 ZI-data=144
    }
\]
where
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt, topsep=0pt, partopsep=0pt, parsep=0pt]
    \item \( \texttt{RO} \): Read-Only data
    \item \( \texttt{RW} \): Read-Write data
    \item \( \texttt{ZI} \): Zero-Initialised data
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{1em}
The total ROM and RAM requirements for the program can be seen in the \( \texttt{.map} \) file that is generated after compilation.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{tables/size.tex}
\end{table}
